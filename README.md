Welcome to my personal project repository focusing on Spring Security, a robust authentication and access-control framework for Java applications. In this project, I've explored the depths of Spring Security to implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for my Java-based applications. This project showcases the power and versatility of Spring Security in real-world scenarios.

#Project Overview
In this personal endeavor, I've delved into various aspects of Spring Security, encompassing both authentication and authorization processes. The project demonstrates how Spring Security can be tailored to meet specific requirements, making it an ideal choice for securing my personal applications.

#Project Highlights
Form-Based and Basic Authentication: Implemented form-based authentication and basic authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure user login and access control.

Role-Based and Permission-Based Authorization: Utilized roles and permissions to enforce authorization policies, allowing different levels of access based on user roles and permissions.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) Implementation: Explored the world of JWT to enable stateless authentication, enhancing security while maintaining scalability.

Database Authentication: Integrated database authentication, managing application users securely in a database, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
